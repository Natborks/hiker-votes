    <h1>Hi there! I'm Nathanel</h1>
    <p>
      I am a passionate developer with a keen interest in building scalable,
      user-friendly applications. Beyond coding, I enjoy airplanes, hiking, and
      volunteer work. The projects below showcase some of the work I’ve done
      across personal, professional, and academic domains. (A nicer website is
      in the works)

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hiker Votes</strong>
            A poll widget to poll my friends on which hikes to do this summer.
            Uses the following tech stack: React, Spring Boot, Docker,
            Terraform, AWS(ECS, FARGATE), Cloudflare.

            <strong>Real-Time Logistics Tracker</strong>
            This project is a real-time driver dispatch and monitoring system
            designed to simulate the coordination of delivery drivers during
            emergencies. It includes a WebSocket server (Node.js) and a
            React-based dashboard for interacting with driver data in real time.
            The system allows dispatchers to pause/resume drivers, complete
            trips, and reassign tasks dynamically. Driver locations are
            simulated and periodically updated for demonstration purposes.

        <h2>Real-World (Professional) Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>YouStart</strong>
            A government-backed platform helping individuals and entrepreneurs
            apply for startup loans online. I led the team that built the
            project, creating intuitive React interfaces for applicants and
            developing an admin dashboard to manage applications. Our work
            improved accessibility, reduced manual processing, and expanded
            financial reach.

            <strong>Ramafrique</strong>
            Ramafrique is an online retailer specializing in exquisite African
            bags featuring unique designs and vibrant colors. I contributed to
            the project by developing and managing the financial payment
            processing system, ensuring secure and seamless transactions.

            <strong>Zipyer</strong>
            Led the architecture and development of a cloud-native rideshare
            platform delivering bespoke ride management solutions. The backend
            is built as an event-sourced Spring Boot application leveraging
            PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Ambar Event Bus, integrated with
            unsupervised machine learning algorithms to optimize ride
            operations. Currently, the project is nearing completion under my
            technical leadership.

            <strong>Ski Resort</strong>
            A ski app that allows users to easily find amenities in a ski area.
            For this project, I really enjoyed applying Andy Bell’s Every Layout
            principles to compose the responsive main page. Please visit:

              take approximately 50 seconds to start from a cold state. Thank
              you for your understanding!</em
