# ðŸ¥¾ Trail Poll

This is a little app I threw together for me and the gang to vote on which trail weâ€™re hiking next.

## What it does

Itâ€™s simple:

- Shows a list of trail options
- Everyone casts a vote
- The one with the most votes wins
- Democracy prevails

## Tech Stuff

Just React + Node + MongoDB â€” keeping it lightweight.
Using MongoDB because I'm probably going to be changing the schema a lot.

## Diagrams

Check the root folder for C4 context and container diagramsif youâ€™re curious how things are wired up or wanna expand it.
